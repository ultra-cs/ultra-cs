Hi, I'm Amir Roknabadi (Tuxify).

I'm a Red Team trainee focused on learning offensive security fundamentals through hands-on labs and real practice.  
I spend most of my time on enumeration, basic web vulnerabilities, and understanding how attacks work in controlled environments.

My goal is to build strong fundamentals, document what I learn, and steadily improve my technical skills through consistent practice.
